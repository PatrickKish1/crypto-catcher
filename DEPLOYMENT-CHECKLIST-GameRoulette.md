- [ ] npm packages installed (`npm install`)
- [ ] Hardhat configured for Base Sepolia
- [ ] Environment variables set in `.env.local`
- [ ] Private key with sufficient Base Sepolia ETH
- [ ] Alchemy API key configured

### Contract Dependencies
- [ ] VRF contracts deployed and verified
- [ ] Blocklock contracts deployed and verified
- [ ] UserManager contract deployed

- [ ] All contract addresses documented

### Network Configuration
- [ ] Base Sepolia RPC endpoint configured
- [ ] Etherscan API key for Base Sepolia
- [ ] Gas price strategy configured
- [ ] Network ID: 84532 (Base Sepolia)

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Compile Contracts
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```
- [ ] GameRoulette.sol compiles without errors
- [ ] All dependencies resolve correctly
- [ ] Artifacts generated in `artifacts/` folder

### Step 2: Update Deployment Script
```bash
# Edit scripts/deploy-game-roulette.js
```
- [ ] VRF_SENDER_ADDRESS updated with real address
- [ ] BLOCKLOCK_SENDER_ADDRESS updated with real address
- [ ] Deployer address matches your wallet
- [ ] Network configuration correct

### Step 3: Deploy Game Roulette
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-game-roulette.js --network base-sepolia
```
- [ ] Contract deploys successfully
- [ ] Contract address recorded
- [ ] Gas used documented
- [ ] Transaction hash saved

### Step 4: Verify Contract
```bash
npx hardhat verify --network base-sepolia <address> <vrf-sender> <blocklock-sender> <owner>
```
- [ ] Contract verified on Etherscan
- [ ] Source code visible
- [ ] Constructor arguments correct
- [ ] ABI matches deployed contract

### Step 5: Update Configuration
- [ ] `lib/game-roulette-config.ts` auto-generated
- [ ] Contract address correct
- [ ] ABI complete and accurate
- [ ] Game types and difficulty levels defined

## 🧪 Post-Deployment Testing

### Contract Functionality
- [ ] `createRouletteSession` works
- [ ] `requestNextGame` works
- [ ] `saveGameState` works
- [ ] `resumeGame` works
- [ ] `createSealedRouletteSession` works

### VRF Integration
- [ ] VRF requests are sent correctly
- [ ] Randomness callbacks received
- [ ] Game switching works as expected
- [ ] Difficulty levels assigned randomly

### Blocklock Integration
- [ ] Sealed sessions created
- [ ] Multipliers encrypted correctly
- [ ] Decryption callbacks received
- [ ] Multipliers revealed on time

### Frontend Integration
- [ ] Game Roulette page loads
- [ ] Wallet connection works
- [ ] Session creation triggers wallet
- [ ] Game components render correctly
- [ ] State management works

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### Check Contract State
```bash
# Get contract owner
npx hardhat console --network base-sepolia
> const GameRoulette = await ethers.getContractFactory("GameRoulette")
> const gameRoulette = GameRoulette.attach("0x...")
> await gameRoulette.owner()
```

### Test Basic Functions
```bash
# Test session creation (requires wallet connection)
npx hardhat run scripts/test-game-roulette.js --network base-sepolia
```

### Monitor Events
```bash
# Check for deployment events
npx hardhat run scripts/debug-game-roulette.js --network base-sepolia
```
